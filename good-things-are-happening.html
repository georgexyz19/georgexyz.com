      <p>It’s been over a year since I last updated this site. Life has been a whirlwind of kids and work, 
leaving little room for reading and writing. But recently, I’ve found myself diving back into reading, 
and I decided to find time to start writing again.</p>
<h3>Bing CoPilot</h3>
<p>One exciting development on my radar is Bing Copilot. The media buzz around <span class="caps">AI</span>’s impact on our daily 
lives caught my attention, and I decided to explore this tool. The results have been nothing short 
of amazing. Bing Copilot takes my rough email drafts and transforms them into professional, polished 
messages.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: I start by drafting an email in Outlook. Then, I open my browser and head to 
bing.com. On the Copilot page, I type a simple request like &#8220;revise the following email draft for me.&#8221; 
I copy and paste my draft into the Copilot dialog.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the revisions are spot-on. Occasionally, Copilot removes sentences that I’d like 
to keep, but that’s an easy fix—I simply add them back to the revised email.</p>
<p>In a world where <span class="caps">AI</span> is reshaping communication, Bing Copilot is a game-changer. It’s like having a 
skilled editor at my fingertips, ensuring my emails convey professionalism and clarity. So, here’s 
to embracing the future and making the most of these exciting tools!</p>
<h3>Atomic Habits by James Clear</h3>
<p>I’ve recently delved into James Clear’s masterpiece, Atomic Habits, and let me tell you—it’s a 
game-changer. It’s a roadmap to transforming your life, one tiny habit at a time.</p>
<p>Crafted with Precision: Clear’s writing is like a well-tailored suit—sharp, concise, and perfectly 
fitted. Each of the 20 chapters is a gem, packed with actionable insights that leave you nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>Unlocking the Power of Small Changes: Clear’s secret sauce lies in his focus on microscopic 
shifts. He reveals how these seemingly insignificant habits compound over time, shaping our destiny. 
From the cue-routine-reward loop to the magic of habit stacking, this book is a treasure trove of practical wisdom.</p>
<p>A Joyful Read: Unlike some other books (which shall remain nameless), Atomic Habits doesn’t leave you 
scratching your head. Clear’s clarity of thought makes it a joy to read. No more deciphering cryptic 
sentences or re-reading paragraphs—just pure enlightenment.</p>
<h3>The Stayfree App</h3>
<p>After my Atomic Habits revelation, I decided to tackle my digital distractions. Enter the Stayfree app, 
my newfound ally in the battle against mindless phone scrolling.</p>
<p>The Shocking Truth: I discovered I was spending 1 to 2 hours daily lost in the Chrome browser on my phone. 
Yikes! That’s precious time slipping away.</p>
<p>Strayfree to the Rescue: With the Stayfree app, I set strict boundaries during my work hours. No more 
mindless browsing. Just focused productivity.</p>
<p>The Result: My concentration soared, and distractions plummeted. I’m reclaiming my time, one blocked 
app at a time.</p>
<p>So, whether it’s building atomic habits or taming digital demons, remember: small changes yield seismic 
results. </p>

<h3>Original</h3>
<p>The above article is actually revised from the following original texts.  I just quickly 
type down my thoughts and let CoPilot edit the texts. </p>
<hr>

<p>I haven&#8217;t updated this site for over a year.  It has been busy with kids and with job. 
I am doing some reading recenlty. I decided that I should continue to write in the site and 
Some interesting things are happening now. </p>
<p><strong>Bing Copilot</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of buzz in the media that <span class="caps">AI</span> is making a huge impact on our daily lives.  I 
didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it until recenlty.  I tried bing copilot to revise some of my 
work emails. The result is amazing. It will turn my draft into a very professional work email. </p>
<p>Here is how it works.  I wrote a first draft of the email in Outlook.  Then open a brower 
window and go to the site bing.com.  On the copilote page, I type a sentence like &#8220;revise the 
following email draft for me&#8221;, and then copy and paste the draft email to the copilot dialog. </p>
<p>Most times the results are very good.  Occationally I found the copilot delete a few sentences 
for me which should not be deleted.  I simply add them back to the revised email. </p>
<p><strong>Atomic Habit book</strong></p>
<p>I am reading James Clear&#8217;s Atomic Habit book now.  It is a really nice book. The book is really 
well written and well organized.  It has 20 chapters and each chapter is short and sweet.  I 
picked up some good suggestions from the book. </p>
<p>Before this book, I was reading another interesting book (not to name here).  That book content is nice, but it 
is difficult to read and understand.  Sometimes I have to read twice or three times a chapter trying 
to understand what the author is trying to deliver.  After reading that book, this book is a joy to 
read. </p>
<p><strong>Stayfree Android App</strong></p>
<p>After reading the Atomic Habit book, I am searching Android Play store to find if there is any app 
that I can use to restrict my cell phone usage and I found the Stayfree app.  It is interesting to 
see that I spent 1 -2 hours per day on Chrome brower on my phone.  Now I set it up in the Strayfree app 
that during my work hours, I can&#8217;t open Chrome brower on my phone.  It greatly improved my concentration and 
reduced distraction. </p>
