      <p>I bought a new <span class="caps">HP</span> ZBook Firefly <span class="caps">G10A</span> last year with a Ryzen <span class="caps">7840HS</span> <span class="caps">CPU</span> and <span class="caps">32GB</span> <span class="caps">RAM</span>. It’s supposed to be much faster than my old 
laptop, an <span class="caps">HP</span> Firefly G8. However, I’ve found myself rarely using the new laptop, and I always pick up the old one as my first 
choice.</p>
<p>So, I started asking myself: what’s the reason? What’s the point of buying a new laptop if I still prefer the old one? There are 
probably two good reasons why the old Gen 8 Firefly feels better:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Gen 8 version’s trackpad has two physical buttons. The new Gen 10 version removed the buttons, and I really like those 
physical buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wi-Fi on the new laptop doesn’t work very well. Every time I turn on the laptop, I have to reconnect to my home network. 
Also, when I use the laptop in my living room, the signal is very weak. Sometimes the laptop doesn’t pick up any Wi-Fi signal at 
all. None of my other devices, like my phone or other laptops, have this problem. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>After some digging, I found that the MediaTek <span class="caps">MT7922</span> Wi-Fi card was the problem. There are many people complaining about MediaTek 
Wi-Fi cards online. So I asked ChatGPT what a good replacement card would be. The answer was the Intel <span class="caps">AX210</span> Wi-Fi 6E card.</p>
<p>I spent about $17 on eBay and received the card today. It was quite easy to replace the Wi-Fi card, and the difference is 
obvious. The new card completely solved the two <span class="caps">WIFI</span> problems.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I found that the older driver (version 22.0.1.5) performs better than the newer drivers. The internet speed is 
faster, and the signal is stronger with this older driver. I’m not sure why, but I’ll stick with the old driver and hope it lasts 
for a while. </p>
<p>The Intel Wi-Fi card also appears to have issues, particularly with the latest drivers. My desktop <span class="caps">PC</span> uses an <span class="caps">AX211</span> card, 
and the Wi-Fi does not automatically reconnect to the network after waking from sleep. I rolled back from version 23.140.0.3 
to an older driver, 22.150.0.3, which seems to be working fine for now.</p>
