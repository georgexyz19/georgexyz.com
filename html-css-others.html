  <p>This post is an update on what I am working on. </p>
<h4>CSS Books</h4>
<p>I recently re-read the online book <a href="https://internetingishard.com/">HTML/CSS Is Hard</a>. 
I found the book when I was searching for CSS flexbox.  It is an excellent resource to 
learn CSS.  Jon Duckett’s <em>Web Design with HTML and CSS</em> book is a good introductory book, 
but it does not include any advanced features that are often used in practice.  The 
online book covers these topics very well, and the illustrations in the book are wonderful.</p>
<p>I also read another book <em>CSS In Depth</em> by Keith Grant.  This is also an excellent 
book which covers many tricky parts of CSS.  The basic rules of CSS are very 
straightforward, but it is not easy to lay out a nice looking webpage for both 
mobile devices and desktops.  This book discussed many advanced topics in CSS. </p>
<h4>Wget to Download Website</h4>
<p>I searched and found an online article Q/A post 
“<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/14403/how-can-i-download-an-entire-website">How can I download an entire website</a>”. </p>
<p>The post has an answer which shows how to download a website to local hard drive
with Linux command line tool wget.  The command is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wget -m -p -E -k www.excample.com
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>-m : --mirror recursion and time stamping</li>
<li>-p : all images</li>
<li>-E : adjust extension</li>
<li>-k : convert links for local file</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested the command on internetingishard.com and it worked well. </p>
<h4>VS Code</h4>
<p>I have been using vim as main text editor writing python programs for some time. 
However vim is not ideal for coding HTML/CSS webpages.  I install VS code 
in Linux Mint and it works very well.  It also has Emmet auto completion 
built in, and it makes coding HTML/CSS much easier and faster. Youtube has 
<a href="https://youtu.be/5BIAdWNcr8Y">a nice tutorial on how to use Emmet</a> when coding HTML/CSS</p>
<p>The other nice feature of VS Code is that it is easy to install plugins. 
I installed Live Server Addon plugin with a few mouse clicks.  It takes efforts
to make plugins work in vim. </p>
<h4>Inkscape 1.0 Beta Testing</h4>
<p>Inkscape 1.0 Beta is out.  I test it out in Windows and it often crashes. 
It is not ready for production work yet.  The built in Python system has been 
upgraded to 3.7, which is long overdue.  One plugin I wrote (Draw Sign Arrow) for 
Inkscape 0.9.2 works fine in Inkscape 1.0 beta without any changes. </p>
<p>I plan to upgrade all my Inkscape python programs to 3.7 in near future. </p>
