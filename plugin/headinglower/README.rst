Pelican ``headinglower`` plugin
===============================

This plugin lowers heading levels of reStructuredText.  Heading level 1 (<h1>) 
becomes level 2 (<h2>), headling level 2 becomes level 3, and so on. 

The code is based on `headerid` plugin and code in 
`this online artilce <https://www.devdungeon.com/content/restructuredtext-rst-tutorial-0>`_
