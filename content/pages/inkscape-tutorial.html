      <p>
        Inkscape has become my favorite drawing tool after designing with a commercial CAD
        (computer-aided design) software package for several years. Most of my work drawings
        nowadays are designed in Inkscape. It is truly an amazing piece of open software.
      </p>

      <p>
        This set of 12 slides was created in Inkscape when I was learning the software. It
        helps me become familiar with Inkscape and later serves as a reference for myself. I
        hope you will find them useful.
