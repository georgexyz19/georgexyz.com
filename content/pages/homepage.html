          My name is George Zhang, and I am an aspiring full stack web developer with a
          passion for Python.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my personal webpage. It is also a test bed for various web technologies.
          Sometimes I write down some notes, which may be useful for other people. I am
          publishing some materials I have written over the years on this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          The site contains some traffic related articles because I worked as a professional
          traffic engineer for a few years after college.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for your time and feel free to drop me an email <img src="/images/email.svg" alt="email address" />
          if you have any questions or comments.
