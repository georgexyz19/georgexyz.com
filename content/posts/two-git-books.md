This post is about two Git books I recently read.  Git is a complicated tool 
which is not easy to figure out simply by Google searching. 

I start with the O'Reilly book *Version Control with Git 2nd ed* by Jon Loeliger 
and Matthew McCullough. The book is good, and examples in chapters 5 and 6 
are especially nice. However, the book is not an easy read. I read the first 
12 chapters carefully and skim the rest chapters. 

Then I read the more popular book [*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.  Scott Chacon is one of
the founders of github.  The book is freely available on official git website
git-scm.com. This book is excellent.  I especially like the workflow sections
in chapter 5 because those materials are not easy to find online.  I read
the first 6 chapters twice and skim the rest book.  This book is also more
practical for engineers, and you can use the book as a reference for daily
projects. If you only have time for one book, this is the one to get. 
 
One benefit I get from reading the two books is that I can easily understand
the *Source Control* panel in Visual Studio Code. It is very neat VS Code has 
version control system built in.
