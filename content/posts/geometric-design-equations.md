Horizontal and vertical curves are important concepts in a highway design class. 
However, many textbooks do not explain how to derive  equations.  When I 
was preparing for Professional Engineering (PE) exam a few years ago, I spent
some time figuring out how to derive those equations.  I will publish the 
work on this web page.  College students and engineers preparing for PE exam may 
find them useful. 

A simple horizontal curve is an arc (part of a circle).  The curve looks
like this, 

<div style="max-width:800px">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/geometric-design/img-horizontal-curve.svg" alt="simple horizontal curve"> 
</div>

Equations are shown on this PDF page:

If you understand how to derive horizontal curve equation, the Horizontal Sightline Offset (HSO)
equation on page 3-115 of 7th edition of 
[Green Book](https://store.transportation.org/Item/PublicationDetail?ID=4127) 
is very similar.

A vertical curve is a parabola which is more complicated than an arc.  
The curve looks like this:

<div style="max-width:800px">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/geometric-design/img-vertical-curve.svg" alt="simple vertical curve"> 
</div>

The equation derivation is on this PDF:

It can be proved that X = 1/2 * L on the below figure. 

<div style="max-width:800px">

</div>
