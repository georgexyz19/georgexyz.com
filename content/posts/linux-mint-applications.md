I have been using Linux Mint for over a year.  It is the time to get more
serious and examine applications that are popular in Linux Mint. Below is
*System Info* app screen which shows the OS version and other related info.  I
will keep updating this post to add more contents.

###GNOME Terminal

Linux Mint comes with *GNOME Terminal* emulator. It is called *Terminal* on the
desktop menu. Most of my work in Linux Mint are conducted through this program.
One nice thing about the *Terminal* program is the integration with the desktop 
system, and it can be launched through the context menu *Open in Terminal*.

</div>


Below is a *Terminal* window in default size 80 * 24.

The version in Linux Mint 20 is 3.26.1.1. Here is the About window when you
choose menu Help -> About.

alt="Terminal About">
</div>

The program has a better than average help system when you choose the menu Help
-> Contents.  The "Overview of a terminal" section has definitions for terms
such as *Terminal*, *Shell*, *Prompt*.

The *Use tabs* section explains that *Ctrl + Shift + t* shortcut is to open new
tab and *Ctrl + Shift + w* shortcut is to close a tab.

###GNOME Screenshot

The Linux Mint 20 comes with a screenshot app which is actually part of GNOME
desktop system. The official name is *gnome-screenshot*. Below is the version
info under the Terminal. 

```
george@george-desktop:~$ gnome-screenshot --version
gnome-screenshot 3.36.0
george@george-desktop:~$ ls -la $(which gnome-screenshot)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 88824 Apr 27 06:21 /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot

george@george-desktop:~$ gnome-screenshot --help
Usage:
  gnome-screenshot [OPTIONâ€¦]
...

``` 

When I am researching this app online, I find an online article saying that
GIMP also has a screenshot funtion built in.  You can open the screenshot
window by clicking menu item File -> Create -> Screenshot.  The first figure below
is *gnome-screenshot* window and the second figure is GIMP screenshot window.
