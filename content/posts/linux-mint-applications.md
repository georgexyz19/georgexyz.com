I have been using Linux Mint for over a year.  It is the time to get more
serious and examine applications that are popular in Linux Mint. Below is
*System Info* app screen which shows the OS version and other related info.  I
will keep updating this post to add more contents.

###GNOME Terminal

Linux Mint comes with *GNOME Terminal* emulator. It is called *Terminal* on the
desktop menu. Most of my work in Linux Mint are conducted through this program.
One nice thing about the *Terminal* program is the integration with the desktop 
system, and it can be launched through the context menu *Open in Terminal*.

Below is a *Terminal* window in default size 80 * 24.

The version in Linux Mint 20 is 3.26.1.1. Here is the About window when you
choose menu Help -> About.

The program has a better than average help system when you choose the menu Help
-> Contents.  The "Overview of a terminal" section has definitions for terms
such as *Terminal*, *Shell*, *Prompt*.

The *Use tabs* section explains that *Ctrl + Shift + t* shortcut is to open new
tab and *Ctrl + Shift + w* shortcut is to close a tab.
