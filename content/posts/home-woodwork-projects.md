I took a brief time off computers and worked on a few simple wood projects 
at home during my spare time. 

#### Garden Wood Frame

The first project is building wood frames for 
string bean plants in our backyard. The materials are 16 1"x2"x8' pressure 
treated board from Home Depot. They are about $2 each and total cost is 
less than $35. Here is a photo of the frames.

#### Backyard Shoe Rack

The second project is building a backyard shoe rack.  A few other options 
are considered before setting on this one. The materials are recycled 
pallet wood and 6 hooks ($1 ea) from Home Depot. The hooks are mounted 
about 45 degrees into the wood.

#### Under Deck Swing

The neighborhood playground is closed nowadays, so we decide to build an 
under deck swing in the backyard. The number of components are more than 
I thought. Here is a list of materials for the toddler swing. The total 
material cost is about $100. 

Toddler swing

Swing hanger
: Jungle Gym Kingdom heavy duty swing hanger from amazon - $29

We have some materials left over from this project such as wood and 
lag screws, so we decide to build a simple swing/bench near the 
toddler swing. This time uses a much cheaper swing hanger from Home 
Depot. It has a weight rating of 450 lbs which is more than enough 
for us. 

Swing
: 2"x8"x8' wood (22 in long) with white paint

Hanger
: Everbilt porch swing chain kit - $17

Hook and Washer
: 1/4" x 4-1/4" steel hook and 1/4" x 1-1/4" fender washer - $6
