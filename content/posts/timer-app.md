Sometimes I like to time myself to finish a work task in a certain amount of 
time like 15 minutes. Usually I can concentrate on the task more when I work 
under a timer. 

I try to find a simple timer.  This post records the timers I checked out. 

The first thing I tried is a kitchen timer.  I ordered a popular one on 
Amazon and it was delivered the next day.  It works well and it is simple 
to use, but it has a major flaw.  The beep noise level is way too high. 
Obviously the timer is designed for a noisy kitchen environment.

</div>

Then I thought I should find a timer app written in Python, and I can 
modify it to suite my needs.  This 
[github page](https://github.com/topics/countdown-timer?l=python) 
lists 14 countdown timers. I tried a few of them and nothing worked 
well. The app is either too ugly or it needs additional dependencies. 
Many people agree that Python is not a best choice for GUI design. 

So I went back to Google and searched "Online Timer".  It turns out 
Google itself has a basic timer function.  It is good but it does 
not have a beep reminder at the end.  The website timeanddate.com 
has a very nice timer which is the one I am using now.

</div>


Those two online times are probably written in javascript.  It also 
shows why javascript becomes so popular nowadays.  The app is very easy to 
use and no installation is required.
