Sometimes I like to time myself to finish a task in a certain amount of 
time like 15 minutes. I can concentrate on the task more when I work 
under a short duration timer. 

I try to find a simple timer.  This post records the process. 

The first thing I try is a kitchen timer.  I order a popular one on 
Amazon and it is delivered the next day.  It works well, but it has a 
major flaw.  The beeping noise level is way too high. 
The timer is designed for a noisy kitchen environment.

I try to find a timer app written in Python, and I can 
modify it to suite my own needs.  This 
[github page](https://github.com/topics/countdown-timer?l=python) 
lists 14 countdown timers. I test a few of them and none works  
well. The app is either too ugly or it needs additional dependencies. 
Python is not a good choice for GUI apps. 

So I go back to Google and search "Online Timer".  It turns out that 
Google itself has 
[a basic timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+timer) 
function.  It is good but it does 
not have a beeping reminder at the end.  The website timeanddate.com 
has a [very nice timer](https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/) 
which is the one I am using now.

Those two online timers are probably written in javascript.  This 
shows why javascript becomes so popular nowadays.  The app is very easy to 
use and no installation is required.
