It’s been over a year since I last updated this site. Life has been a whirlwind of kids and work, 
leaving little room for reading and writing. But recently, I’ve found myself diving back into reading, 
and I decided to find time to start writing again.

### Bing CoPilot

One exciting development on my radar is Bing Copilot. The media buzz around AI’s impact on our daily 
lives caught my attention, and I decided to explore this tool. The results have been nothing short 
of amazing. Bing Copilot takes my rough email drafts and transforms them into professional, polished 
messages.

Here’s how it works: I start by drafting an email in Outlook. Then, I open my browser and head to 
bing.com. On the Copilot page, I type a simple request like "revise the following email draft for me." 
I copy and paste my draft into the Copilot dialog.

Most of the time, the revisions are spot-on. Occasionally, Copilot removes sentences that I’d like 
to keep, but that’s an easy fix—I simply add them back to the revised email.

In a world where AI is reshaping communication, Bing Copilot is a game-changer. It’s like having a 
skilled editor at my fingertips, ensuring my emails convey professionalism and clarity. So, here’s 
to embracing the future and making the most of these exciting tools!


### Atomic Habits by James Clear

I’ve recently delved into James Clear’s masterpiece, Atomic Habits, and let me tell you—it’s a 
game-changer. It’s a roadmap to transforming your life, one tiny habit at a time.

Crafted with Precision: Clear’s writing is like a well-tailored suit—sharp, concise, and perfectly 
fitted. Each of the 20 chapters is a gem, packed with actionable insights that leave you nodding in agreement.

Unlocking the Power of Small Changes: Clear’s secret sauce lies in his focus on microscopic 
shifts. He reveals how these seemingly insignificant habits compound over time, shaping our destiny. 
From the cue-routine-reward loop to the magic of habit stacking, this book is a treasure trove of practical wisdom.

A Joyful Read: Unlike some other books (which shall remain nameless), Atomic Habits doesn’t leave you 
scratching your head. Clear’s clarity of thought makes it a joy to read. No more deciphering cryptic 
sentences or re-reading paragraphs—just pure enlightenment.

### The Stayfree App

After my Atomic Habits revelation, I decided to tackle my digital distractions. Enter the Stayfree app, 
my newfound ally in the battle against mindless phone scrolling.

The Shocking Truth: I discovered I was spending 1 to 2 hours daily lost in the Chrome browser on my phone. 
Yikes! That’s precious time slipping away.

Strayfree to the Rescue: With the Stayfree app, I set strict boundaries during my work hours. No more 
mindless browsing. Just focused productivity.

The Result: My concentration soared, and distractions plummeted. I’m reclaiming my time, one blocked 
app at a time.

So, whether it’s building atomic habits or taming digital demons, remember: small changes yield seismic 
results.

### Original

The above article is actually revised from the following original texts.  I just quickly 
type down my thoughts and let CoPilot edit the texts. 

<hr>

I haven't updated this site for over a year.  It has been busy with kids and with job. 
I am doing some reading recenlty. I decided that I should continue to write in the site and 
Some interesting things are happening now. 

**Bing Copilot**

There are a lot of buzz in the media that AI is making a huge impact on our daily lives.  I 
didn't pay much attention to it until recenlty.  I tried bing copilot to revise some of my 
work emails. The result is amazing. It will turn my draft into a very professional work email. 

Here is how it works.  I wrote a first draft of the email in Outlook.  Then open a brower 
window and go to the site bing.com.  On the copilote page, I type a sentence like "revise the 
following email draft for me", and then copy and paste the draft email to the copilot dialog. 

Most times the results are very good.  Occationally I found the copilot delete a few sentences 
for me which should not be deleted.  I simply add them back to the revised email. 

**Atomic Habit book**

I am reading James Clear's Atomic Habit book now.  It is a really nice book. The book is really 
well written and well organized.  It has 20 chapters and each chapter is short and sweet.  I 
picked up some good suggestions from the book. 

Before this book, I was reading another interesting book (not to name here).  That book content is nice, but it 
is difficult to read and understand.  Sometimes I have to read twice or three times a chapter trying 
to understand what the author is trying to deliver.  After reading that book, this book is a joy to 
read. 

**Stayfree Android App**

After reading the Atomic Habit book, I am searching Android Play store to find if there is any app 
that I can use to restrict my cell phone usage and I found the Stayfree app.  It is interesting to 
see that I spent 1 -2 hours per day on Chrome brower on my phone.  Now I set it up in the Strayfree app 
that during my work hours, I can't open Chrome brower on my phone.  It greatly improved my concentration and 
reduced distraction.
