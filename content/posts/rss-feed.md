The 
[Pelican documention](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/themes.html#feeds)
has a short section on ATOM/RSS feed.  I have seen RSS/ATOM feed links somewhere before, but never paid 
much attention to them.  A Google search finds these two nice introduction articles. 

- [A Few Simple Benefits of Using An RSS Feed](https://www.business2community.com/blogging/a-few-simple-benefits-of-using-an-rss-feed-0144503)
- [How to Subscribe to or Read an RSS Site Feed or an ATOM Feed](https://www.thesitewizard.com/faqs/howtoreadsitefeeds.shtml)

The first linked article has a sentence which explains the benefit of RSS/ATOM Feed very well. 

> The main benefit of RSS is that instead of having to go out to each individual 
> website and see if there is any new content, content comes to you in one centralized location. 

The Firefox web browser has an extension Feedbro which is easy to use.  I subscribe five 
websites I often visit and it works well. Most major websites have RSS feeds available, and only 
one website I visit often does not have one.  As for this personal blog site, I do not have 
many updates and do not plan to provide RSS feeds.
