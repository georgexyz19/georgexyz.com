#### Force Firefox to Refresh

There are two quick ways to refresh web page in Firefox browser. 

1. Press `Shift` key and click refresh (reload) button,
2. Shortcut is `Ctrl + Shift + r`.

The fresh button is the third one on the image shown below: 
<div style="max-width:800px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-3" src="/images/refresh-button.png" alt="ff refresh button">
</div>
