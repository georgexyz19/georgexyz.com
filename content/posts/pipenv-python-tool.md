Pyenv is the tool I use to install multiple versions of python in Linux, and I have 
[a short post on how to install pyenv]({filename}pyenv-python-tool.md). I simply use the python built-in tool venv to manage virtual environment. It works fine for most tasks. 

William Vicent recommends pipenv tool in his *Django for Beginners* book. Corey Schafer also 
favors pipenv in this youtube tutorials. I take a close look at the tool and I like it. 

Here are the links to two youtube videos and an article on real python website. Those are very nice resources to learn pipenv.
