note: about logitech mouse M525
no: 86

I haven’t updated this website for a while. I discovered something interesting today I would like to share on this site.  My favorite mouse is Logitech wireless mouse model M525.  I have several M525 mouses and dongles for different computers. 

We can use the [Logitech Unifying software](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297913-Logitech-Unifying-Software) to reprogram the USB dongle to match different Logitech wireless mouses and keyboards.  However the software needs Windows Admin right to install.  My work computer does not have it installed. 

Today at work I am in an awkward situation where I have a USB dongle plugged into my work laptop and a M525 mouse which is not linked to the dongle.  I also don’t have a personal laptop nearby so I can't use my personal laptop to reprogram the dongle.

I was wondering if there is a portable version of the Unifying software which does not require the Admin right to install.  A google search did not find any such software.  However, A reddit post points to an official Logitech web version of Unifying software which does not need installation. 

Here is the [reddit post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/11nth9e/logitech_unifying_software_without_admin_rights/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). 

This is the link to Logi Web Connect application.

 The web application likely uses JavaScript to access the USB dongle and can reprogram it.  With the web application, I do not need the Unifying software anymore.  That’s the only function I am using Unifying software for. Logitech did a great job of providing the web application but I never know it exists.  Most Logitech users probably don’t know either. 

This experience also shows that JavaScript is so versatile.  No one likes to install an application if we can open a webpage to do the same thing.
