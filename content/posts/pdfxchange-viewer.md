Most office workers more or less deal with PDF files.  PDFXchange Viewer has been 
my favorite PDF reader for several years.  It is so good that I switched my 
calendar from paper copy to electronic PDF file. This is the type of software that
I wish I could write as a developer. 

The software was produced by a Canadian company 
[Tracker Software](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer),
and it has a free portable version which includes lots of useful feathers.  Here 
is a quote from the website,

> PDF-XChange Viewer 'Free Version' is free for private and commercial use,
> provided it is not bundled with other software for financial gain. The
> Viewer as well contains extra features and functions that are unlocked when
> you purchase a license for PDF-XChange Viewer PRO. 

It has a portable ZIP version which a user can extract files into any
local directory.  The size of extracted files is about 15MB. I only copy four files 
`PDFXCview.exe`, `resource.dat`, `Portable.dat`, and `Settings.dat` to new directories
and it seems to work without problem.

The free version contains many feathers.  I mostly use two functions: line drawing 
and typewriter.  I map the key `l` to line drawing and key `w` for typewriter. 
I also map key `-` to zoom out and `=` to zoom in, which is the same as in
[Inkscape](/pages/inkscape-tutorial.html). 

So, the advantages of PDFXchange View are, 

1. It is free but of really high quality;
2. Easy to customize; and
3. Small and portable.
