Apple had [an event](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-april-event-recap/) 
three days ago announcing several new products. One announcement catches my attention. 
They are replacing old style Apple TV remote. It gets my attention because I bought an Apple TV 
a few years ago and it came with the remote. The remote is just a bad design. It looks fancy 
but it lacks accuracy for controlling anything on TV. 

This makes me think I should write something down regarding good and bad designs. 
It is just my personal opinion and the post records some of my thoughts as time goes by. 

##Good Design

###Screen Capture Menu in Android OS 9

In Android OS 9, you press and hold the power button to bring up a menu. It has three options, and 
one of them is Screenshot.

<div style="max-width: 400px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-3" src="/images/design/android-cap1.JPG" alt="Andriod capture"> 
</div>

However, it changed in later Android versions. You need to press two keys together to capture a screen 
in some version. It is not difficult, but the design is not as good as this one.
