This post describes some good python resources that I found useful. Python has many 
resources, sometimes it becomes difficult for people to figure out which are good 
and which are not. 

#### Automate The Boring Stuff with Python

I am a big fan of Al Sweigart's book. He is very kind to provide the [HTML version 
of the book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) online for free. I bought the hard 
copy and Udemy class, but the online version is very handy when I want to look 
something up quickly.  

A presentation on youtube titled [Recursion for Beginners: A Beginner's Guide to 
Recursion](https://youtu.be/AfBqVVKg4GE) by Al Sweigart is also worth checking out.

#### Google's Python Class

[Google has a free class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) 
for people who want to learn Python.  The class was created by Nick Parlante and 
was originally given to new Google employees.  The contents of the class are quite 
good. It also comes with well-designed exercises for each lecture.  

#### A Byte of Python (OOP Chapter)

Most introductory Python materials do not discuss python classes.  Classes and 
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are everywhere for any serious Python 
work. I found the 
[OOP chapter](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) 
of a free online book *A Byte of Python* by Swaroop C H is a good introduction to the topic.   

#### Python Reference 

This [Python Reference](https://github.com/justmarkham/python-reference) 
github page by Kevin Markham is very nice summary of Python language features.

#### Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python

 [This presentation](https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go) 
 by Raymond Hettinger is excellent.  Someone has prepared the 
 notes and posted them on github.  Here is the link to 
 [the github notes](https://gist.github.com/0x4D31/f0b633548d8e0cfb66ee3bea6a0deff9).

I read the notes a few times and found that many examples apply to my existing python code. 
If I get a chance to revise those code, I will make sure they follow those recommendations.

#### Fluent Python

I am currently reading Luciano Ramalho's *Fluent Python* book.  I am half way through the 
book and it is good.  The book covers many contents that I probably will never use, but it is 
always good to know more than we need.  

#### Podcasts

I regularly listen to *Talk Python To Me* and *Python Bytes* podcasts.  They keep me in 
the loop of a larger Python community.
