I didn't add new post to this website for sometime. The reason is that I am busy 
working on a new website. 

[www.inkscapetutorial.org](https://www.inkscapetutorial.org)

The website contains some Inkscape materials and Inkscape extension development 
articles.  I set a deadline of 9/1/2021 to launch the website and the site becomes 
alive on that date.  It still needs some work such as updating slides and adding 
more articles. Though the site is not fancy, but it takes time to 
build it. I am also removing some Inkscape related material from this site.
