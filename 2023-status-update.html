      <p>I haven’t updated this website for a while.  I have been busy both at work and at home. </p>
<p>I discovered something interesting which I would like to share on this site today.  I tried many computer mouses before and settled with Logitech M525.  I have several M525 mouses and dongles for different computers. </p>
<p>I know that we can use the <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297913-Logitech-Unifying-Software">Logitech Unifying software</a> to reprogram the <span class="caps">USB</span> dongle to match different Logitech wireless mouses and keyboards.  However the software needs Windows Admin right to install.  My work computer does not have it installed. </p>
<p>Today at work I am in an awkward situation where I have a <span class="caps">USB</span> dongle plugged into my work laptop and a M525 mouse which is not linked to the dongle.  I also don’t have a personal laptop nearby.  If I have a personal laptop nearby, I can easily install the Unifying software and reprogram the dongle.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if I can find a portable version of the Unifying software which does not require the Admin right to install.  A google search did not find any such software.  However, I found a reddit post which points to an official Logitech web version of Unifying software which does not need installation. </p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/11nth9e/logitech_unifying_software_without_admin_rights/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit post link</a>. </p>
<p>This is the link to Logi Web Connect application.</p>
<p><a href="https://logiwebconnect.com/">https://logiwebconnect.com/</a></p>
<p>The web application likely uses JavaScript to access the <span class="caps">USB</span> dongle and can reprogram it.  With the web application, I do not need the Unifying software anymore.  That’s the only function I am using Unifying software for. Logitech did a great job of providing the web application but I never know it exists.  Most Logitech users probably don’t know either. </p>
<p>This experience also shows that JavaScript is so versatile.  No one like to install a small application if we can open a webpage to do the same thing. </p>
